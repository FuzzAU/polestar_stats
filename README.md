# Polestar Stats

Understand the usage and efficiency of your [Polestar](https://www.polestar.com/)

## About

I drive a [Polestar 2](https://www.polestar.com/polestar-2/) and realised there was no great online tools for drivers to send their log data
to, and have a convenient way to visualise their journeys and efficiencies.

In this project I will build a tool that allows upload of Polestar log files, with visualisation of key metrics that are of interest to users.

I will attempt to do most of the development while live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/FuzzAU).

## Tech Stack

I'll be using Django 4.1 on Python 3.10.
All other tech to be decided live in the flow of the project.

## Dev Environment

I develop on my Windows 10 machine, using WSL2 running Ubuntu 20.04.
